# legoapp
Web app built with Express and Tailwind frameworks to display a customizable lego store inventory. A REST API retrieves and post data. 

Uses EJS templates to render data from a Postgres database, supporting CRUD operations. 

Stores client sessions and user account information using MongoDB and bcrypt for password hashing encryption. Anonymous users must register an account and login to be able to perform some of the CRUD operations on the lego database.  

Integrated Quotable API support.
